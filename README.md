# CatApp

## Overview

CatApp is a delightful mobile application that lets users explore and enjoy a collection of cat and dog images from various APIs. Whether you're a cat lover, a dog enthusiast, or just someone looking for adorable animal pictures, CatApp has got you covered.

### Features

- **Cat and Dog Images:** Explore a vast collection of cat and dog images from different sources.

- **Toggle Between APIs:** Switch between cataas.com and thecatapi.com to see a variety of cat images.

- **Random Dog Images:** Fetch random dog images from dog.ceo for a dose of canine cuteness.

## Technical Details

### Technologies Used

- **Kotlin:** The entire app is written in Kotlin, a modern and expressive programming language for Android development.

- **Android Studio:** The official IDE for Android app development, providing a powerful and feature-rich environment.

- **Glide:** A fast and efficient image loading library for Android that handles image loading and caching.

- **OkHttp:** A robust HTTP client for making network requests, ensuring smooth communication with APIs.

- **Coroutines:** Leveraging Kotlin coroutines for asynchronous programming, enabling responsive UI and efficient network requests.

- **Gson:** A library for JSON serialization and deserialization, crucial for handling API responses.

### Architecture

CatApp follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture, promoting separation of concerns and maintainability.

- **Model:** Represents the data and business logic of the application, including classes for API data (CatData, DogData) and data parsing functions.

- **View:** Represents the UI components, implemented in XML layout files.

- **ViewModel:** Acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View, handling UI-related logic and exposing data to the UI.

### Asynchronous Programming

Coroutines are employed to perform asynchronous tasks, such as fetching images from APIs. This ensures a responsive user interface and optimal network request handling.
